Located in the modern Parque das Nações district, Lisbon's Oceanário is consistently ranked among the best aquariums in the world. But it's much more than just a collection of fish tanks. It’s an architectural marvel with a powerful conservation message, designed to make you feel like you're exploring a single, global ocean.

Built for the last world's fair of the 20th century, Expo '98, whose theme was "The Oceans, a Heritage for the Future," the Oceanário's very structure is a pier surrounded by water. To truly appreciate it, you need to understand its brilliant design and the secrets it holds.

## The "One Ocean" Concept

The genius of the Oceanário lies in its unique layout. Unlike most aquariums that separate exhibits by species, Lisbon’s is built around a colossal central tank, representing the open "Global Ocean." This massive tank holds 5 million litres of saltwater and is home to sharks, majestic rays, schools of tuna, and a giant sunfish.

Surrounding this central tank, at the corners of the building, are four other habitats representing a different ocean each:

1.  **The North Atlantic:** Featuring the rugged, rocky coasts with puffins and razorbills.
2.  **The Antarctic:** Home to the charismatic Magellanic penguins.
3.  **The Temperate Pacific:** Where you'll find the incredibly playful and clever sea otters.
4.  **The Tropical Indian:** A stunning coral reef environment, bursting with colorful fish.

The design is brilliant because as you walk, you see the animals of the central tank from different angles, and then you duck into these smaller, immersive habitats. It creates the illusion that all oceans are interconnected—which is precisely the point.

### Beyond the Main Tank: Unmissable Highlights

*   **The Sea Otters (Amália & Eusébio):** Named after Portuguese icons, these otters are famous for their intelligence and playful antics. Try to catch their feeding time for a real show.
*   **The Temporary Exhibition:** Always check what's on in the temporary exhibition space. These are often world-class installations focusing on art and conservation, like the stunning "Forests Underwater" by Takashi Amano.
*   **The Leafy Seadragons:** In one of the smaller tanks, look for these magical creatures. They are masters of camouflage and a true marvel of evolution.
