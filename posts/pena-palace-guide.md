## The King's Romantic Dream

Forget medieval fortresses built for war. Pena Palace was born in the 19th century from the mind of King Ferdinand II, the "Artist-King". He was a German prince who married a Portuguese queen and fell in love with Sintra. He bought the ruins of an old monastery on the highest peak and decided to build a summer residence that was a pure expression of Romanticism – an artistic movement that valued emotion, nature, and individualism.

### Secret #1: The Meaning of the Colors

The vibrant colors aren't random. The ocher yellow represents the gothic and medieval influences, while the terracotta red is a nod to the Moorish architecture still visible all over Portugal. King Ferdinand wasn't just painting a palace; he was telling a story of Portugal's architectural history on its walls.

### Secret #2: The Triton's Welcome

Pay close attention to the archway of the main entrance. That half-man, half-fish creature holding a shell is Triton, a mythological god of the sea. It's a dramatic, almost theatrical piece designed by the king himself, symbolizing the creation of the world. You are literally entering a new world of fantasy.
